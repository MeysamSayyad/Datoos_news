# Datoos News:React + Typescript + vite

This is a simple project setup using Vite, a fast and opinionated build tool for modern web development.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   Use npm or yarn to install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   Run the following command to start the development server with hot module replacement (HMR):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
   The server will start, and you can access your application at `http://localhost:5173/` by default.

## Building for Production

To create an optimized build for production, run:
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
The build files will be generated in the `dist` directory.

## Previewing the Build

To preview the production build locally:
```bash
npm run preview
# or
yarn preview
```
This will start a local server to serve the production build.

## Scripts

The following scripts are available in the project:

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server
- `npm run build`: Build the project for production
- `npm run preview`: Preview the production build
